Lab 7: String Manipulation and Conditional Statements

In this lab, you will practice working with strings and conditional statements.


Write a program that asks the user to enter a string and prints out whether the string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards (e.g. "racecar", "level", "deified").

Write a program that asks the user to enter a string and a substring, and prints out how many times the substring appears in the string.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a string and checks if it contains any of the following characters: "$", "%", "#", "@", "!". If the string contains any of these characters, print out a warning message saying "Your string contains special characters!".

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 100, and prints out whether the number is odd or even. If the user enters a number outside of this range, print out an error message saying "Number must be between 1 and 100!".

Remember to comment your code and test your programs thoroughly!
