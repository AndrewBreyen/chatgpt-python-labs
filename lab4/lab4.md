Welcome to your fourth lab in Python! In this lab, we will be building on the concepts covered in the previous labs and introducing some new ones.

1. Open up a new Python file and save it as "lab4.py".

2. In this lab, we will be working with file handling and error handling. Write a program that asks the user for a file name and attempts to open the file. If the file cannot be opened, print out an error message. If the file is opened successfully, read the contents of the file and print it out to the console.

3. Next, let's practice using modules in Python. Import the "math" module and use its sqrt() function to calculate the square root of a number entered by the user. Then, print out the result.

4. Let's also practice using classes and inheritance in Python. Create a class called "Animal" with attributes "name" and "species". Add a method to the class called "speak" that prints out a message indicating that the animal is making a noise. Then, create a subclass called "Cat" that inherits from the Animal class and overrides the "speak" method to print out "meow". Create an instance of the Cat class and call the "speak" method.

5. Now let's move on to working with APIs in Python. Use the "requests" module to make a GET request to the following API: "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all". Print out the response content in JSON format. Use Pretty Print to get the response formatted nicely.

6. Lastly, let's practice using regular expressions in Python. Write a program that asks the user for a string and checks if it matches the pattern "^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$". If the string matches the pattern, print out a success message. If it does not match the pattern, print out an error message.

7. Save your file and run it. Make sure you are able to see the output in the console.

Congratulations, you have completed your fourth lab in Python!
