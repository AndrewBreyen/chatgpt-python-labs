Overview: In this lab, we will be building a simple text-based adventure game using Python. We will use basic programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditional statements to create a game that asks the player to make choices and navigate through a story.

Instructions:
1. Define a function called "start_game" that will start the game and display the opening text to the player. 
2. Create a variable called "player_name" that will store the name of the player. Ask the player to enter their name using the "input" function.
3. Use the "print" function to display a welcome message that includes the player's name.
4. Define a function called "choose_path" that will prompt the player to choose a path. The function should display a message to the player that describes the two paths they can choose from. 
5. Use the "input" function to allow the player to choose a path.
6. Use conditional statements to determine which path the player has chosen. Display a message to the player based on their choice.
7. Define a function called "play_again" that will ask the player if they want to play again. Use the "input" function to allow the player to enter their choice.
8. Use conditional statements to determine if the player wants to play again. If they do, call the "start_game" function again. If not, use the "print" function to display a goodbye message.

Hints:
- Be creative with your story and the choices that the player can make.
- Use loops to ensure that the game continues until the player chooses to end it.
- Use functions to organize your code and make it easier to read and modify.
- Use comments to document your code and explain what each section does.
