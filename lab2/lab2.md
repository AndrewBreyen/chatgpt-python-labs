# Lab 2
Welcome to your second lab in Python! In this lab, we will be building on the concepts covered in the first lab and introducing some new ones.

1. Open up a new Python file and save it as "lab2.py".

2. In this lab, we will be working with strings. Start by creating a string variable called "message" and assign it a value of your choice. Then, print out the length of the string using the len() function.

3. Next, let's practice string concatenation. Create two string variables, "first_name" and "last_name", and assign them your first and last name, respectively. Then, concatenate them together and print out the full name.

4. Let's also practice string indexing. Using the "message" variable from step 2, print out the first and last characters of the string.

5. Now let's move on to loops. Create a for loop that prints out the numbers from 1 to 10.

6. Let's also practice using lists in Python. Create a list called "my_list" and add at least 5 items of your choice. Then, print out the length of the list and print out each item in the list using a for loop.

7. Lastly, let's practice using functions. Create a function called "multiply" that takes in two arguments and returns the product of the two numbers. Then, call the function with some sample values and print out the result.

8. Save your file and run it. Make sure you are able to see the output in the console.

Congratulations, you have completed your second lab in Python!
