Lab 6: Functions

In this lab, we will explore functions and their usage in Python.

1. Write a function called `square` that takes a number as an argument and returns the square of that number.
2. Write a function called `is_even` that takes a number as an argument and returns `True` if the number is even and `False` otherwise.
3. Write a function called `print_hello` that takes no arguments and prints the string "Hello, world!" to the console.
4. Write a function called `add` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of those numbers.
5. Write a function called `multiply` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the product of those numbers.
6. Write a function called `greet` that takes a parameter `name`.
    - Print to the console "Hello, [name]!".
    - If the user doesn't enter a name as a parameter, greet them with "Hello, stranger!" instead.
7. Write a function called `calculate_area` that takes the radius of a circle as an argument and returns the area of the circle.
8. Write a function called `calculate_hypotenuse` that takes the length of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as arguments and returns the length of the hypotenuse.
9. Write a function called `calculate_factorial` that takes a number as an argument and returns the factorial of that number.
10. Write a function called `calculate_mean` that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the mean (average) of those numbers.
