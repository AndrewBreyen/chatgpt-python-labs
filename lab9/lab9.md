Lab 9: Data Processing with Python

In this lab, we will explore some basic data processing techniques using Python. We will be working with a CSV file containing information about employees at a company.

1. Download the employee data CSV file from this link: employees.csv.zip

2. Open the CSV file using Python's built-in `csv` module. This module provides functionality for reading and writing CSV files.

3. Loop through the rows of the CSV file and print out the name and age of each employee.

4. Calculate the average age of the employees and print it out.

5. Write a function to find the employee with the highest salary. The function should take in the CSV file as an argument and return the name of the employee with the highest salary.

6. Use the `pandas` library to read the CSV file into a `DataFrame`. This library provides functionality for working with data in a tabular format.

7. Sort the `DataFrame` by salary in descending order and print out the top 5 employees.

8. Use the `matplotlib` library to create a bar chart showing the number of employees in each department.

Note: If you need help with any of the concepts or libraries, feel free to refer back to previous labs or use online resources to guide you.
