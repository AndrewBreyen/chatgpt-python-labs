# Lab 3

Welcome to your third lab in Python! In this lab, we will be building on the concepts covered in the previous labs and introducing some new ones.

1. Open up a new Python file and save it as "lab3.py".

2. In this lab, we will be working with conditional statements and loops. Write a program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

3. Next, let's practice using dictionaries. Create a dictionary called "my_dict" and add at least 5 key-value pairs of your choice. Then, print out the length of the dictionary and print out each key-value pair in the dictionary using a for loop.

4. Now let's move on to file handling. Create a text file called "my_file.txt" and write some text to it. Then, read the contents of the file and print it out to the console.

5. Let's also practice using modules in Python. Import the "random" module and generate a random number between 1 and 10. Then, print out the number.

6. Lastly, let's practice using classes in Python. Create a class called "Person" with attributes "name" and "age". Add a method to the class called "greet" that prints out a greeting message using the person's name. Then, create an instance of the class with your name and age and call the "greet" method.

7. Save your file and run it. Make sure you are able to see the output in the console.

Congratulations, you have completed your third lab in Python!
