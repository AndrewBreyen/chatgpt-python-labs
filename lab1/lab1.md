# Lab 1

Welcome to your first lab in Python! In this lab, we will be covering the basic syntax and concepts of Python programming. 

1. Start by opening up a Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment) of your choice. If you don't have one installed, we recommend downloading and installing VSCode.

2. Create a new Python file and save it as "lab1.py".

3. In this lab, we will be printing out some basic messages to the console. Start by printing out the message "Hello, world!" using the print() function. Make sure to include the quotes around the message.

4. Next, let's practice using variables. Create a variable called "name" and assign it the value of your name (in quotes). Then, print out a message that says "My name is [your name]" using the variable.

5. Now let's do some basic math in Python. Create two variables, "num1" and "num2", and assign them both a value. Then, add them together and print out the result.

6. Lastly, let's practice using conditional statements. Create a variable called "age" and assign it a value. Then, write an if statement that checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, print out the message "You are old enough to vote". If it is not, print out the message "You are not old enough to vote yet".

7. Save your file and run it. Make sure you are able to see the output in the console.

Congratulations, you have completed your first lab in Python!
