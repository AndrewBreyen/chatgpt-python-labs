Lab 8: String Manipulation and List Comprehension

In this lab, you will practice working with strings and list comprehension.

### Part 1: String Manipulation

1. Define a string variable called `sentence` with the following value: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

2. Convert all the characters in `sentence` to uppercase and print the result.

3. Replace the word "fox" in `sentence` with the word "cat" and print the modified sentence.

4. Count the number of occurrences of the letter "o" in `sentence` and print the result.

5. Define a string variable called `word` with the value "Python". Use string concatenation to print the following sentence: "I am learning Python programming."

### Part 2: List Comprehension

1. Define a list variable called `numbers` with the following values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

2. Use list comprehension to create a new list called `squares` that contains the squares of all the numbers in `numbers`. Print the `squares` list.

3. Use list comprehension to create a new list called `evens` that contains only the even numbers from `numbers`. Print the `evens` list.

4. Use list comprehension to create a new list called `odds` that contains only the odd numbers from `numbers`. Print the `odds` list.

5. Define a list variable called `words` with the following values: "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry", "fig".

6. Use list comprehension to create a new list called `lengths` that contains the length of each word in `words`. Print the `lengths` list.

### Bonus Challenge

Write a Python function called `reverse_words` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the order of the words reversed, but the order of the characters within each word remains the same.

Example:
```
reverse_words("hello world") -> "world hello"
reverse_words("the quick brown fox") -> "fox brown quick the"
```

### Submission

Submit your Python code in a file called `lab8.py`. Make sure to comment your code appropriately.
