# Lab 5

Welcome to your fifth lab in Python! In this lab, we will be building on the concepts covered in the previous labs and introducing some new ones.

1. Open up a new Python file and save it as "lab5.py".

2. In this lab, we will be working with databases in Python.
    - Install the "sqlite3" module using pip. (In a terminal, run ‘pip install sqlite3’)
    - Create a new SQLite database called "my_db" and a table called "users" with columns for "id", "name", and "email". Insert at least three rows of data into the table.

3. Next, let's practice using SQL queries in Python. Write a program that selects all rows from the "users" table and prints out the results.

4. Let's also practice using APIs and data manipulation in Python. Use the "requests" module to make a GET request to the following API: "https://api.coinlore.net/api/tickers/?limit=10". Print out the name and price of each cryptocurrency returned by the API.

5. Lastly, let's practice using object-oriented programming in Python. Create a class called "Rectangle" with attributes "length" and "width". Add methods to the class for calculating the area and perimeter of the rectangle. Then, create an instance of the class with some sample values and call the area and perimeter methods.

6. Save your file and run it. Make sure you are able to see the output in the console.

Congratulations, you have completed your fifth lab in Python!
